Build Sites Faster
===
Parsec is a series of components and boilerplates to create sites faster. Is intended use is Triangle-related sites, but it can also be used on other projects. **Are you ready to build sites as fast as the Millennium Falcon?**

## Components

### SASS Boilerplates
- `parsec_main.sass`: Includes variables and basic styling for any site. Used as the main boilerplate for <a href="https://triangle.mx" target="_blank" "_">triangle.mx</a>.

### Custom Bootstrap Build
We use a **Custom Bootstrap Build** in a vast majority of our sites, that's why we implemented it as part of `Parsec`.
